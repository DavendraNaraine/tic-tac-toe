# tic-tac-toe (C program)
Percept-based algorithm - Computer plays by selecting random move at all times.

Rule-based algorithm - Rules apply as follows:
  1. Look at each placement for a win. If found take it otherwise continue.
  2. Look at each placement for an opponent's win. If found, take it for a block otherwise continue.
  3. Look at the center square. If open take it otherwise continue.
  4. Look at the 4 corners of the board. Randomly choose from any open ones. None open, continue.
  5. Look at the 4 sides and randomly choose from any open ones. None open, Then the game is a tie.

State-space-based algorithm -
